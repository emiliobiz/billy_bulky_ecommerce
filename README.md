# Billy Bulky E-Commerce Data Project

## Context

In the competitive field of e-commerce, data-driven decision-making is key to understanding customer behavior, optimizing inventory, and tracking sales performance. The Billy Bulky project leverages a modern data stack to transform raw e-commerce data into actionable insights.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a robust data transformation layer using dbt (data build tool) to model e-commerce data for a fictional company, Billy Bulky. The aim is to showcase skills in data analysis, data modeling, and the utilization of dbt Core features within a data warehousing environment.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three primary dbt modeling layers, each serving a distinct purpose in the transformation pipeline:

- **Staging Layer (`/staging`):** Raw data from source systems is lightly transformed for consistency and cleanliness.
- **Intermediate Layer (`/intermediate`):** More complex transformations are applied, such as customer segmentation and product performance metrics.
- **Marts Layer (`/marts`):** Final transformations produce the dimensional models and fact tables optimized for analytics and BI tool consumption.

## Models and Metrics

- **Customer Segmentation (`int_customer_segmentation`):** Metrics and purchase patterns provide insights into customer behavior.
- **Product Performance (`int_product_performance`):** Aggregates product data to calculate sales performance, inventory turnover, and profitability.
- **Sales Trends (`int_sales_trends`):** Analyzes sales data over time to discern trends and seasonal patterns.
- **Sales Fact Table:** Centralizes sales data, linking customers and products to record transactional facts.

## Tools Leveraged

- **Snowflake:** Efficient storage and compute power to query large volumes of e-commerce data.
- **dbt Core:** Utilized for running transformations, testing data integrity, documenting the data models, and compiling the project.
- **SQL:** The primary language for data modeling and transformation within dbt.
- **Git:** For version control and collaboration, ensuring best practices in code maintenance and deployment.

## Best Practices

Throughout the project, we have adhered to several best practices:

- **DRY Principle:** Ensuring that our SQL code is not repetitive by using dbt's ref() function to reference models.
- **Modular Design:** Each model is built to be independent, ensuring changes can be made with minimal impact on other models.
- **Version Control:** All changes are tracked through git, with a clear commit history and branching strategy.
- **Testing and Documentation:** Each model includes tests for data integrity and is well-documented for clarity and maintainability.

## Setup and Configuration

The project's setup involves configuration files such as `dbt_project.yml`, which defines the project structure and model materialization strategies, and `.yml` files in each model directory for documentation and testing configurations.

## Conclusion

This project represents a comprehensive approach to e-commerce data analysis, with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and the delivery of valuable business insights. It serves as a testament to the capabilities of dbt and modern data practices in the field of analytics.
